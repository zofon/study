	abstract = "{Providing fault tolerancy is crucial for a growing number of IP-based applications. There exist a lot of proprietary solutions for this problem, but free alternatives are rare.
Currently, the IETF RSerPool working group is standardizing a protocol suite for Reliable Server Pooling, which copes with the challenge of providing high availability by using redundant servers. Servers for the same service are grouped into a server pool. A server in a pool is called pool element (PE), a user of a pool is called pool user (PU). When a PE fails, its PUs simply select another one from the pool and initiates an application-specific failover procedure. This fail-over is supported by the RSerPool protocol suite. Each PE registers at a name server and is then continously supervised by that specific name server. All name servers of an operational scope provide a redundant system for name resolution from pool handles to transport addresses of pool elements to pool users. RSerPool uses SCTP to provide network fault tolerance and address scoping functionality.
The RSPLIB is a prototype implementation of the RSerPool protocol suite, developed under the GNU Public License in cooperation between Siemens and the Computer Networking Technology Group of the University of Essen. It currently runs under Linux, FreeBSD and Darwin.
Our paper covers aspects of designing and implementing highly available applications using RSerPool with our RSPLIB implementation. First, we will give an introduction to the RSerPool protocol suite and an overview of the RSPLIB components. Then, we describe the RSPLIB API, especially focussing on the implementation of pool element and pool user programs to provide high reliability. Furthermore, we show our current implementation status and future plans. This will be followed by a short look on the problems that can arise when the RSerPool architecture is used. Finally, we give an example how RSerPool can be used to realize highly available services. And last but not least, we show how distributed computing architectures can make use of the RSerPool architecture.}",

At the heart of this new mobility concept is the reliable transport protocol SCTP, with an enhancement for dynamic address reconfiguration. This is described in this paper. A session layer based on the reliable server pooling (RSerPool) protocol suite provides for sessionmonitoring and control. The suggested solution is transparent for applications,requires no changes in the network infrastructure, and is evaluated with a real-world implementation.
Finally, we present first results from the application of this mobility concept to different mobility scenarios. These were obtained from working SCTP and RSerPool implementations that have been developed within our group.}",

RSerPool is currently under standardization, its functionality and improvement are subject of our research.
Our poster presents our RSerPool proof-of-concept implementation and a research oriented, discrete event based simulation model. We provide some simulation results showing problems of the server selection procedures defined in the standards and how we solved them. These improvements are now going into standardization by the IETF. Furthermore, we present some of our important results on efficient algorithms and data structures for pool management.

Since most of the time a server pool system runs without component failures, optimal performance is an extremely important issue for the productivity and cost-efficiency of the system. In this paper, we therefore focus especially on the load distribution performance of RSerPool in scenarios without failures, presenting a quantitative performance comparison of the different load distribution strategies (called pool policies) defined in the RSerPool specifications.

Im Anschluß daran wenden wir uns kurz dem API der rsplib zu und zeigen, wie eigene Programme mit dessen Hilfe hochverfügbar gemacht werden können. Neben neuer, direkt auf RSerPool basierender Software, berücksichtigen wir dabei insbesondere auch die Anpassung bestehender Applikationen und stellen Möglichkeiten zur Migration vor. Zum besseren Verständnis werden sämtliche Beschreibungen von Code-Beispielen begleitet.

In our paper, we present an approach to add distance-awareness to the RSerPool architecture, based on features of the SCTP transport protocol. This approach is examined and evaluated by simulations. But to also show its usefulness in real life, we furthermore validate our proposed extension by measurements in a PlanetLab-based Internet scenario.}",

VoIP-Vermittlungsanlagen zur Weiterleitung von Notrufen oder e-Commerce-Anwendungen sind nicht akzeptabel. Zur Sicherstellung der Verfügbarkeit von Diensten bei Geräte- und Netzwerkausfällen müssen diese Komponenten redundant ausgelegt sein. Spezialisierte Redundanzlösungen – insbesondere z.B. für Web-Server – gibt es zwar viele, eine einheitliche, für viele Dienste nutzbare Lösung fehlte jedoch noch. Reliable Server Pooling, abgekürzt RSerPool, ist ein Rahmenwerk zur Bereitstellung hochverfügbarer Anwendungen durch redundante Server, es befindet sich zur Zeit in der Standardisierung durch die IETF RSerPool-Arbeitsgruppe. Im RSerPool-Konzept werden Server, welche den gleichen Dienst anbieten, zu einem Pool zusammengefaßt. Neben der Hauptaufgabe – der Verfügbarkeit von Diensten – ist insbesondere auch die Lastverteilung ein wichtiges Anwendungsgebiet von RSerPool.
Im Rahmen eines Forschungsprojektes haben wir -- die Arbeitsgruppe Technik der Rechnernetze am Institut für Experimentelle Mathematik der Universität Duisburg-Essen -- im Jahre 2002 damit begonnen, einen plattformunabhängigen RSerPool-Prototypen als Open Source unter GPL-Lizenz zu entwickeln. Mittlerweile wird unser Projekt durch die Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) gefördert. Unser System läuft zur Zeit unter Linux, FreeBSD, Darwin (MacOS X) und Solaris, wobei die Unterstützung für weitere Plattformen – insbesondere auch für Embedded-Systeme – geplant ist. Als einzige vollständige Implementierung des zukünftigen RSerPool-Standards sind wir Referenzimplementierung der IETF RSerPool-Arbeitsgruppe und wirken mit Tests und Forschungsarbeiten aktiv in der Standardisierung mit.
In unserem Vortrag geben wir zunächst eine kurze Einführung zu RSerPool. Dabei wollen wir insbesondere auch die Merkmale verdeutlichen, die RSerPool von existierenden Lösungen – wie Linux Virtual Server (LVS) oder dem kommerziellen Cisco Distributed Director – unterscheiden. Außerdem wollen wir zeigen, welche speziellen Funktionalitäten RSerPool bietet um den Nutzen eines Serverpools sowohl für dessen Betreiber als auch für den Anwender zu optimieren: die Möglichkeit zur vollautomatischen Konfiguration von Komponenten und die Festlegung pool-spezifischer Serverauswahlregeln. Diese Funktionalitäten werden wir am Beispiel einer Anwendung von RSerPool für Real-Time Distributed Computing verdeutlichen.
Im zweiten Teil unseres Vortrags werden wir auf unsere Open Source Implementierung rsplib eingehen. Neben dem Aufbau der einzelnen Komponenten werden wir insbesondere auch interessante Details der Implementierung vorstellen und beschreiben, wie wir auftretende Probleme erfolgreich lösen konnten. Insbesondere wollen wir dabei auch unsere gesammelten Erfahrungen beim Erstellen von auf unterschiedlichen Betriebssystemen (Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS X, Solaris) und Hardware (x86, x64, PPC) lauffähiger Software vorstellen. Im Anschluß daran zeigen wir, wie das RSerPool-API dazu genutzt werden kann, eigene Anwendungen hochverfügbar zu machen und die Möglichkeiten zur Lastverteilung im Pool verwendet werden können. Ein Schwerpunkt dieser Einführung wird dabei insbesondere die einfache und effiziente Realisierung des Failover-Mechanisms sein, d.h. des Verfahrens zur Wiederherstellung eines Sitzungszustandes auf einem neuen Server nach Ausfall des alten. Im Besonderen werden wir dabei zeigen, welche Fähigkeiten RSerPool und sein API mitbringen um dieses – teilweise recht komplexe Thema – in vielen Fällen übersichtlich und mit wenigen Zeilen Programmcode zu lösen: Hochverfügbarkeit für eigene Anwendungen muß nicht kompliziert sein!
Zum Abschluß stellen wir noch unsere Beispielanwendung vor, ein System zum verteilten Berechnen von Fraktalgrafiken. Mit diesem System lassen sich die grundlegenden Eigenschaften von RSerPool – welche im Vortrag vorgestellt wurden – sehr anschaulich demonstrieren: die Verwaltung dynamischer Pools, Lastverteilung und Failover bei Serverausfall. Selbstverständlich werden wir unser Beispielsystem beim Vortrag auch in der Praxis demonstrieren, bei Vorhandensein eines Internetzugangs sogar mit einem Szenario aus weltweit verteilten Ressourcen.}",

Server redundancy has to take load distribution and load balancing into consideration since these issues are crucial for the system performance.
There has already been some research on the server selection strategies of RSerPool for different application scenarios. In particular, it has been shown that the adaptive Least Used selection usually provides the best performance. This strategy requires up-to-date load information of the services, which has to be propagated among distributed pool management components. But network delay (which is realistic for systems being widely distributed to achieve availability in case of regional servers failures) as well as caching of information may both lead to obsolete load information. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to analyse and evaluate the performance of a new server selection rule to cope with update latencies. Especially, we will also analyse the impact of different workload parameters on the performance of the new server selection strategy.}",

A number of research papers have already addressed the service and pool management performance of RSerPool in general. However, the important topic of security, including the system robustness against intentional attacks, has not yet been intensively addressed. In particular, none of the proposed Denial of Service~(DoS) attack countermeasure mechanisms has been evaluated in a real-world Internet setup.
For that reason, this paper provides an analysis of the robustness of RSerPool systems against DoS attacks. We will outline the DoS attack bandwidth which is necessary for a significant service degradation. Furthermore, we will present simple but effective DoS attack countermeasure mechanisms to significantly reduce the impact of attacks. Our analysis is based on a real-world Internet setup using the
PlanetLab. We will furthermore compare the performance measurements against simulation results.}",

This article introduces our concept of a novel network QoS device being located in network edge nodes. It provides a solution for relaxed QoS guarantees to certain flows on a congested link by focussing packet discard on selected flows. However, unlike for IntServ solutions like RSVP, our approach only requires minimal signalling and therefore provides both efficiency and scalability.

To support the development and operation of such applications, the IETF has recently defined a new standard for a common server redundancy and session failover framework: Reliable Server Pooling~(RSerPool).

Service availability achieved by the redundancy of servers directly leads to the issues of load distribution and load balancing, which are both important for the performance of RSerPool systems. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the performance of such systems with respect to the load balancing strategy required by the service application.
In this article -- which is an extended version of our paper~[1] -- we first present an overview of the RSerPool architecture with a focus on the component failure detection and handling mechanisms.

In this paper, we describe our approach of combining CMT with the idea of Resource Pooling~(RP) in order to achieve a performance improvement over non-CMT transfer while still remaining fair to concurrent flows on congested links. Unlike existing approaches which adapt classic TCP to a multi-homed CMT protocol, our approach does not depend on specific characteristics of TCP. Instead, we base on already entrenched functional blocks of CMT transfer, on the example of the CMT-enabled SCTP~(Stream Control Transmission Protocol).

Each functional building block provides a particular service, which -- in interaction with the other functional building blocks -- is able to provide a service similar to the classic OSI Transport Layer. The concept allows for easy removal, replacement or addition of existing and new functional building blocks to adapt the service to state-of-the-art and future requirements, particularly including multi-path transport and QoS.}",

But the Internet itself is not a good test environment, since its components are not controllable and certain problem situations (like congestion or error conditions) are difficult to reproduce. Various testbeds have been built up to fill this gap. Most of these testbeds also support link emulation, i.e.\ using software to mimic the characteristic behaviour of certain kinds of network links (like bandwidth bottlenecks or error-prone radio transmissions). The most popular link emulation systems are the Linux-based NetEm and Dummynet, which are e.g.\ applied on the IP~layer of Planet-Lab and various other testbeds. However, the restriction to the OSI Network Layer (here:~IP) is insufficient to test new non-IP Future Internet protocols.
In this paper, we first introduce Dummynet and NetEm. After that, we will present our approach of adapting Dummynet for Linux to support link emulation on the Data Link Layer. Finally, we evaluate the applicability and performance of Dummynet and NetEm for link emulation on the Data Link Layer, in a Planet-Lab-based testbed environment. Our goal is to outline the performance and limitations of both approaches in the context of Planet-Lab-based testbeds, in order to make them applicable for the evaluation of non-IP Future Internet protocols.}",

Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Lines~(ADSL) are an inexpensive way to add a secondary Internet access connection. With the development of Multi-Path Transport Layer protocols -- like Multipath~TCP~(MPTCP) and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol~(SCTP) furnished by a Concurrent Multipath Transfer~(CMT-SCTP) extension -- there is also a strong interest in utilising all access connections simultaneously to improve the data throughput of the applications. However, combining network paths over ADSL with paths over other access technologies like fibre optic links implies highly dissimilar paths with significantly different bandwidths, delays and queuing behaviours. Efficient Multi-Path transport over such dissimilar paths is a challenging task for the new Transport Layer protocols under development.
In this paper, we show the difficulties of Multi-Path transport in a real-world dissimilar path setup which consists of a high-speed fibre optic link and an ADSL connection. After that, we present an optimised buffer handling technique which solves the transport efficiency issues in this setup. Our optimisation is first analysed by simulations. Finally, we also show the usefulness of our approach by experimental evaluation in a real Multi-Homed Internet setup.}",

Having multiple Internet access paths, it seems straightforward to utilise them simultaneously in order to improve payload throughput by so-called Concurrent Multipath Transfer~(CMT). Currently, CMT extensions for the two important Internet Transport Layer protocols -- Multipath-TCP~(MPTCP) for TCP and CMT-SCTP for SCTP -- are in the focus of IETF standardisation. A challenge -- which is currently very actively discussed in the IETF context -- is congestion control for these CMT protocols.
Based on the idea of Resource Pooling~(RP), two approaches are currently discussed in the IETF: our own approach CMT/RP for CMT-SCTP as well as the MPTCP congestion control for MPTCP. Both approaches only have been roughly tested yet -- mostly in similar path setups, i.e.\ paths having almost the same QoS characteristics, using "their" protocol. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to compare the existing approaches. Particularly, we also analyse more challenging scenarios containing dissimilar paths, i.e.\ paths having differing characteristics. Our goal is to provide insight into the different approaches, to support the IETF standardisation activities on CMT.}",

Currently, CMT is a quite hot topic in the IETF -- in form of the Multipath~TCP~(MPTCP) and CMT-SCTP protocol extensions for TCP and SCTP. However, an important issue is still not fully solved: multipath congestion control.
In order to support the IETF activities, we have set up a distributed Internet testbed for CMT evaluation. An important tool -- which we have developed for multi-protocol Transport Layer performance analysis -- is the Open Source
NetPerfMeter tool-chain. It supports the parametrisation and processing of measurement runs as well as results collection, post-processing and plotting. However, its key feature is to support multiple Transport Layer protocols, which makes a quantitative comparison of different protocols -- including state-of-the-art features like CMT -- possible.

NetPerfMeter and then show a proof-of-concept performance evaluation of CMT congestion controls which are currently discussed in the IETF standardisation process of CMT-SCTP.}",

In consequence, there is a rising demand for so-called multi-path transfer, which utilizes all of these interfaces simultaneously in order to maximize the payload throughput of applications. Currently, this so-called multi-path transfer is very actively discussed by the IETF, in form of the Multi-Path TCP~(MPTCP) extension for TCP as well as the Concurrent Multi-path Transfer extension for SCTP~(CMT-SCTP). Their larger-scale deployment in the Internet is expected for the near future.
A key issue that prevents the standardization of these approaches is the fairness to concurrent TCP flows. A multi-path transfer should behave "TCP-friendly", i.e.\ cause no harm to the performance of the very widely deployed TCP-based applications. In this paper, we first extend the notion of "fairness" from single-path transport to multi-path transport. Furthermore, we introduce the relevant congestion control approaches in the IETF context for single-path as well as multi-path transfer. We simulatively analyze these approaches in a couple of interesting network configuration scenarios, in order to show their behavior with special regard to the fairness definitions. Particularly, we also point out items of further discussion which are the result of the current approaches.}",

While it has originally been built for less critical services like e-mail and file transfer, it is nowadays also increasingly often used for availability-critical services like e.g.\ e-commerce or healthcare. Clearly, the reachability of such services must be ensured by so-called multi-homing of endpoints. That is, endpoints are simultaneously connected to multiple Internet Service Providers~(ISP) to provide redundancy. If one ISP has problems, it is intended that the connection to another one still works. However, such assumptions have never been verified in real, large-scale setups.
The intention of the NorNet project is to build up a realistic Internet testbed for multi-homing. In this paper, we describe the design of NorNet with focus on the implementation of its fixed-line part: NorNet Core. This paper is intended to give researchers an overview of its mode of operation, its capabilities as well as its interesting feature realisations. The knowledge about these items is very useful to plan own experiments in the NorNet testbed.}",

This so-called multi-homing also leads to the desire of utilising multiple network paths simultaneously, in order to improve application payload throughput. Clearly, this so-called multi-path transfer feature is also very useful for the transport of multimedia contents, particularly when a single network access alone is not fast enough to fulfil the bandwidth requirements of the application.
In many cases, multimedia transport is also sensitive for delays and packet losses. However, the focus of the current multi-path transfer approaches has been on bandwidth only. In order to tackle this challenge, our paper introduces two new send strategies to map payload data to different wireless paths. Finally, by using measurements, we show that a significant performance improvement for delay and loss-sensitive applications can be achieved in comparison to the existing approaches.}",

Nowadays, a large number of important services -- for instance e-commerce, healthcare and many others -- depend on the availability of the underlying network. Clearly, service interruptions due to network problems may have a severe impact. On the long way towards the Future Internet, the complexity will grow even further. Therefore, new ideas and concepts must be evaluated thoroughly, and particularly in realistic, real-world Internet scenarios, before they can be deployed for production networks. For this purpose, various testbeds -- for instance PlanetLab, GpENI or G-Lab -- have been established and are intensively used for research. However, all of these testbeds lack the support for so-called multi-homing.
Multi-homing denotes the connection of a site to multiple Internet service providers, in order to achieve redundancy. Clearly, with the need for network availability, there is a steadily growing demand for multi-homing. The idea of the NorNet Core project is to establish a Future Internet research testbed with multi-homed sites, in order to allow researchers to perform experiments with multi-homed systems. Particular use cases for this testbed include realistic experiments in the areas of multi-path routing, load balancing, multi-path transport protocols, overlay networks and network resilience. In this paper, we introduce the NorNet Core testbed as well as its architecture.}",

WLAN links have already been studied extensively in the literature. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on Mobile Broadband~(MBB) networks that are in use today. We utilized
NorNet Edge nodes that are connected to up to five different 3G ISPs (UMTS and CDMA2000), hence, providing a realistic view on the QoS characteristics that are experienced by end-users of these MBB networks. We present QoS characteristics (e.g.\ bandwidth, delay and loss) and discuss our observations. Our results shed light on what a multi-path transport endpoint has to expect -- and to efficiently cope with -- when using today's MBB networks as transport paths.}",

A transport protocol can make use of this best effort service to provide a suitable service to its applications. Also, its congestion control is responsible for a fair distribution of the resources within the Internet. However, background data transfer applications (like file sharing or update fetching) do not require "best effort", they in fact could use a "lower-than-best-effort" service to leave resources to more important applications if needed. For this purpose, the Low Extra Delay Background Transport~(LEDBAT) algorithm has been standardized by the IETF.
Nowadays, multi-homing is becoming increasingly common in modern networks and several approaches to exploit this feature (e.g.\ CMT-SCTP, MPTCP) have evolved that are able to combine resources of multiple paths. For background traffic oriented algorithms like LEDBAT, this feature could be of great use, too, i.e.\ by increasing the overall bandwidth while shifting the transmission away from paths which are used by other flows. This could be particularly useful for non-critical bulk transfers in data centres. In this paper, we introduce our approach LEDBAT for Multi-Path -- denoted as LEDBAT-MP -- and analyze its performance by simulations. With this paper, we want to highlight some generic design questions and start a discussion on how a solid universal background multi-path congestion control strategy should behave.}",

In this paper, we introduce a novel distributed monitoring system with Sensor nodes located in Norway, Germany and China that allow to detect SIP-based attacks from the Internet. Based on experiences from experiments spanning several years, we propose a new setup which allows simple and straightforward addition of new remote observation points. We have deployed this setup in the NorNet testbed and highlight its advantages compared to a previous setup with physically distributed Sensors. We also present results from a 45~day field test with 13 observation points. These results confirm the advantages of a widely distributed monitoring setup and give some new insights into the behavior of the attackers.}",

Not so many Internet service providers offer direct IPv6 connectivity to their customers, yet. Clearly, when IPv6 is available to customers, they expect that IPv6 offers at least the same -- or even better -- stability of connections in comparison to IPv4. The main goal of this paper is to investigate whether this is true today.
In our paper, we present up-to-date measurement results on the stability of IPv4 and IPv6 paths in the real Internet, based on machines that are distributed over a large geographical area, as part of the NorNet Core testbed infrastructure for multi-homed systems. The measurements not only cover high-speed research networks, but also consumer-grade ADSL connections -- i.e. the ISP connection types of "normal" end-users -- as well as a broad range of different ISPs. The measurements show that IPv6 paths are less stable than corresponding IPv4 paths. We also find that the use of load balancing is more prevalent in IPv6 than in IPv4.}",

	abstract = "{Nowadays, cloud applications are becoming more and more popular. However, in order for such applications to work, they need a stable Internet connectivity. To avoid the Internet access becoming a single point of failure, redundancy by multi-homing -- i.e.\ simultaneous access to multiple Internet service providers~(ISP) -- is becoming increasingly common as well. Multi-homing leads to the desire to utilise all network attachment points simultaneously, which is e.g.\ provided by the Multi-Path TCP~(MPTCP) extension for TCP. MPTCP is still under development by researchers and standardisation in the IETF. Particularly, it is necessary to evaluate MPTCP under realistic Internet conditions.
NorNet Core is the world's first, large-scale Internet testbed for multi-homed systems and applications. It is therefore a useful platform for evaluating MPTCP. In this paper, we therefore present our NorNet Core extension that adds MPTCP support to the testbed. Particularly, our extension is now available to all users of NorNet Core as well, which significantly reduces the effort of MPTCP researchers to evaluate MPTCP and its improvements. In a proof of concept, we furthermore show the strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art MPTCP in NorNet Core, in a configuration covering 29~ISP connections at 14~sites in 5~different countries.}",

Researchers can run experiments on distributed, programmable nodes that are distributed over various locations and providing access to multiple different Internet service providers~(ISP) with different access technologies.
Clearly, a key feature of this testbed is to work in the real-world Internet. That is, it is especially desired to expose experiments to real Internet behaviour like background traffic. However, for the researcher, it is necessary to actually know how paths -- being used for an experiment -- actually behave: Are the paths actually working? How are the round-trip times among sites over different ISPs, etc.. How did the behaviour change over time?
To provide such information to the researchers, we have designed and developed a maintenance and monitoring infrastructure for the NorNet Core testbed. In this paper, we will first introduce this infrastructure. Furthermore, we will demonstrate its usefulness with some useful, real-world examples. Our infrastructure has now become part of the testbed, and it is therefore available for all users of NorNet Core as well.}",

This makes multi-homing with IPv4 and IPv6 increasingly common even with just a single ISP connection. Furthermore, the growing popularity of multi-path transport, especially Multi-Path TCP~(MPTCP) that is the extension of the well-known Transmission Control Protocol~(TCP), leads to the question of whether this identity duality can be utilized for improving application performance in addition to providing resilience. In this paper, we first investigate the AS-level congruency of IPv4 and IPv6 paths in the Internet. We find that more than 60\% of the current IPv4 and IPv6 AS-paths are non-congruent at the AS-level, which motivates us to explore how MPTCP can utilize the IPv4/IPv6 identity duality to improve data transfer performance. Our results show that MPTCP, even with a single dual-stack Internet connection, can significantly improve the end-to-end performance when the underlying paths are non-congruent. The extent of the improvement can reach up to the aggregate of the IPv4 and IPv6 bandwidth.}",

	abstract = "{Initially, the Internet transport protocol TCP has been designed to provide a ``best effort'' service: it is meant to share the network resources with other users and applications. However, there is nowadays also a growing demand for transmitting big amounts of data in the background, namely background transport that uses spare capacity, but with minimal effect on other traffic. For instance, systems can proactively download content that the user/system would need in the future (e.g.\ update packages, video files, etc.). Efforts have therefore been made in the IETF for the sake of such a service with Low Extra Delay Background Traffic~(LEDBAT) congestion control. While LEDBAT works in some cases, there are however known situations where it causes serious performance problems, particularly in combination with the ubiquitous bufferbloat for example in current broadband networks.
	In this paper, we analyse the issues of LEDBAT and propose a new approach for background traffic. Inspired by an astronomical event, we have named this approach Eclipse. Unlike LEDBAT, Eclipse can dynamically adapt to the network characteristics not only to minimise the additional network delay but also to maximise the utilisation of spare network capacity. We will show the usefulness of Eclipse by simulations.}",

With the increasing deployment of multipath transport protocols such as Multipath TCP (MPTCP) and the Concurrent Multipath Transfer extension of SCTP (CMT-SCTP), the term "fair" can have various interpretations. In this paper, inconsistencies are avoided by classifying fairness definitions according to the resource -bottleneck or network - and the participants - subflow, flow, tariff, etc. that share the resource. With example network scenarios the current (TCP-compatible) fairness view from both the single and multipath perspective is presented and their short-comings discussed. Alternative definitions are introduced and their benefits are illustrated based on a theoretical analysis. The realization aspects of the discussed fairness definitions are also presented. The evaluations of available coupled congestion control variants for multipath transport are shown to highlight the proximity of the simulated results to the theoretical target values. Due to the complexity of the realization of network-based approaches, bottleneck is chosen as the preferred resource. Tariff is a promising participant as it couples applications and incorporates economic entities for fair resource sharing at the transport layer.}",

different participants is known to be difficult but even the theoretical calculation of the resource capacity and its allocation is not a trivial task. Therefore in this work, resource allocation algorithms are presented to thoroughly evaluate the impact of the
fairness definitions. For a rigorous analysis, existing fairness definitions are identified according to the resources (bottleneck or network) and the competing participants (flow, tariff or user). Tariff as the participant, provides a realistic option to comply with the service level agreement between the operator and the user where as flow as the participant leads to TCP-compatible allocation. From the obtained results, it can be seen that if fairness is applied at the bottleneck then it is absolutely fair to the individual participants w.r.t. the bottleneck. On the other hand, fairness mechanisms considering the whole network as a single resource exploit the freedom of resource allocation (due to multipath flows) to achieve an overall similar allocation for the different participants (irrespective if the participant is composed of singlepath or multipath flows) but are still restricted by the topological constraints and might even result in a lower overall network throughput.}",

	abstract = "{Multipath TCP (MPTCP) enables the simultaneous usage of multiple links for bandwidth aggregation, better resource utilization and improved reliability. Its coupled congestion control intends to reap the increased bandwidth of multiple links, while avoiding to be more aggressive than regular TCP flows on every used link. We argue that this leads to a very conservative behavior when paths do not share a bottleneck. Therefore, in this paper, we first quantify the penalty of the coupled congestion control for the links that do not share a bottleneck. Then, in order to overcome this penalty, we design and implement a practical shared bottleneck detection (SBD) algorithm for MPTCP, namely MPTCP-SBD. Through extensive emulations, we show that MPTCP-SBD outperforms all currently deployed MPTCP coupled congestion controls by accurately detecting bottlenecks resulting in throughput gains of up to 30\% in the absence of shared bottlenecks while remaining fair to TCP in shared bottlenecks scenarios. We complement the emulation results with real-network experiments justifying it is safeness for deployment.}",

We consider Concurrent Multi-path Transfer for SCTP~(CMT-SCTP) and Multi-Path TCP~(MPTCP) and evaluate their proficiency in transporting video, gaming, and web traffic over combinations of WLAN and 3G interfaces. To ensure the validity of our evaluation, several experimental approaches were used including simulation, emulation and live experiments. When paths are symmetric in terms of capacity, delay and loss rate, we find that the experienced latency is significantly reduced, compared to using a single path. Using multiple asymmetric paths does not affect latency -- applications do not experience any increase or decrease, but might benefit from other advantages of multi-path communication. In the light of our conclusions, multi-path transport is suitable for latency-sensitive traffic and mature enough to be widely deployed.}",

Since more than one subflow is used, an efficient multipath scheduling algorithm is needed at the sender. The objective of the scheduler is to identify the subflow over which the current data packet should be sent. This paper compares the most important types of schedulers for multipath transfers. We model their performance analytically and derive key metrics, most notably the resulting end-to-end delay over heterogeneous paths. Our results show that a scheduler minimizing the packet delivery delay yields the best overall performance, but it is complex to realize. An alternative scheduler based on the sender queue size is simpler and has sufficient performance for relatively small asymmetry between the multiple paths. Our model results are confirmed by measurements with a real multipath transport protocol.}",

This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the use of MPTCP to reduce latency and thus improve the quality of experience or QoE for cloud-based applications. In particular, the paper considers the possible reductions in latency that could be obtained by using MPTCP and multiple network paths between a cloud service and a mobile end user. To obtain an appreciation of the expected latency performance for different types of cloud traffic, three applications are studied, Netflix, Google Maps, and Google Docs, representing typical applications generating high-, mid-, and low-intensity traffic. The results suggest that MPTCP could provide significant latency reductions for cloud applications, especially for applications such as Netflix and Google Maps. Moreover, the results suggest that MPTCP offers a reduced latency despite a few percent packet loss, and in spite of limited differences in the round-trip times of the network paths in an MPTCP connection. Still, larger differences in the round-trip times seem to significantly increase the application latency, especially for Netflix, Google Maps, and similar applications. Thus, to become an even better alternative to these applications, this paper suggests that the MPTCP packet scheduling policy should be changed: Apart from the round-trip times of the network paths in a connection, it should also consider the difference in round-trip time between the network paths.}",

Resilience subsumes the disciplines of survivability, fault-tolerance, disruption-tolerance, traffic-tolerance, dependability, performability, and security. This presentation will provide a brief introduction to the disciplines and challenges to network resilience, and to our complex-systems analysis and heuristics to improve infrastructure resilience under cost constraints. Then, this presentation will describe ongoing work in the design and analysis of a new composable, cross-layered resilient transport (ResTP) and geodiverse multipath routing protocol (GeoDivRP). These protocols are designed to are being developed to provide resilience and survivability in the face of targeted attacks and large-scale disasters to the network infrastructure.}",

Such performance degradation in turn can adversely impact the user experience. In this paper, we study packet loss characteristics of MBB networks under mobility using six measurement nodes that are placed on regional and inter-city trains in Norway for a period of seven months. Our findings show that packet loss is significantly higher for mobility scenarios compared to the stationary. In order to understand the cause of packet loss, we investigate Radio Access Technology (RAT) changes, temporary loss of service, and changes in cells and location area codes (LAC). We surprisingly find that almost all periods with RAT changes involve packet loss. We also observe that 70\% of the overall loss happens in periods with RAT changes or temporary loss of service. Further, one third of RAT changes involve connection termination. Our findings highlight the importance of radio access network (RAN) planning and configuration, and provide guidelines to alleviate packet loss in MBB networks.}",

Across both networks we study, we observe connections with round trip delays of several seconds, often multiple times per hour, that are more frequent when nodes are moving. Correlating these extreme delay events with available metadata, we find they are related to handovers, radio state transitions, and retransmissions at the link and physical layers.}",

	abstract = "{Mobile broadband networks play an increasingly important role in society, and there is a strong need for independent assessments of their robustness and performance. A promising source of such information is active end-to-end measurements. It is, however, a challenging task to go from individual measurements to an assessment of network reliability, which is a complex notion encompassing many stability and performance related metrics. This paper presents a framework for measuring the user-experienced reliability in mobile broadband networks. We argue that reliability must be assessed at several levels, from the availability of the network connection to the stability of application performance. Based on the proposed framework, we conduct a large-scale measurement study of reliability in 5 mobile broadband networks. The study builds on active measurements from hundreds of measurement nodes over a period of 10 months. The results show that the reliability of mobile broadband networks is lower than one could hope: more than 20\% of connections from stationary nodes are unavailable more than 10 minutes per day. There is, however, a significant potential for improving robustness if a device can connect simultaneously to several networks. We find that in most cases, our devices can achieve 99.999\% ("five nines") connection availability by combining two operators. We further show how both radio conditions and network configuration play important roles in determining reliability, and how external measurements can reveal weaknesses and incidents that are not always captured by the operators existing monitoring tools.}",

We find that the IPv6 network is maturing, albeit slowly. While most core Internet transit providers have deployed IPv6, edge networks are lagging. Early IPv6 network deployment was stronger in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, than in North America. Current IPv6 network deployment still shows the same pattern. The IPv6 topology is characterized by a single dominant player -- Hurricane Electric -- which appears in a large fraction of IPv6 AS paths, and is more dominant in IPv6 than the most dominant player in IPv4. Routing dynamics in the IPv6 topology are largely similar to those in IPv4, and churn in both networks grows at the same rate as the underlying topologies. Our measurements suggest that performance over IPv6 paths is comparable to that over IPv4 paths if the AS-level paths are the same, but can be much worse than IPv4 if the AS-level paths differ.}",

	abstract = "{In February 2011 the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority~(IANA) exhausted its free pool of IPv4 addresses, and the regional registries (RIRs) have started to run out of IPv4 addresses as well. As RIRs have started rationing allocations, IPv4 transfer markets have emerged as a new mechanism to acquire IPv4 addresses. Barring a few high-profile exceptions, IPv4 transfers have largely flown under the radar. In this work, we use the lists of transfers published by three RIRs to characterize the transfer market - the types of players involved, the sizes and characteristics of transferred address blocks, and visible effects on the routing table. Next, we take first steps toward detecting address transfers using BGP data from the Routeviews and RIPE repositories from 2004-2013. We identify reasons why legitimate changes in prefix origin could be confused as transfers, and implement a series of 10 filters that remove 86\% of candidate transfers. We find the remaining number of inferred transfers is increasing over time. We could confirm few (0.16\%) of these transfers using RIR-published transfer lists, while our inference methodology undoubtedly yields false positives, a black market for IPv4 transfers may exist as well.}",

We first design and implement a generic modular scheduler framework that enables testing of different schedulers for Multipath TCP. We then use this framework to do an in-depth analysis of different schedulers by running experiments on a emulator and a testbed. We consider bulk data transfer as well as application limited traffic and identify metrics to quantify the scheduler's performance. Our results shed light on how scheduling decisions can help to improve multipath transfer.}",

NorNet Edge consists of a large number of dedicated hardware nodes connected to all mobile broadband providers in Norway. The nodes are based on cheap commodity hardware and run a full Linux-distribution, allowing full flexibility in designing and performing measurements. Custom-made software in the nodes automatically detects and configures the network subsystem based on available networks, making them especially well suited for mobile broadband measurements. The software is based on commonly available functionality and is easy to port to different hardware architectures or operating systems. In this paper, we present the architecture and functional goals of NorNet Edge, evaluate important performance aspects of the hardware nodes, and present results from an illustrative measurement experiment.}",

	abstract = "{Aggregate Server Access Protocol~(ASAP, RFC 5352), in conjunction with the Endpoint Handlespace Redundancy Protocol~(ENRP, RFC 5353), provides a high-availability data transfer mechanism over IP networks. ASAP uses a handle-based addressing model that isolates a logical communication endpoint from its IP address(es), thus effectively eliminating the binding between the communication endpoint and its physical IP address(es), which normally constitutes a single point of failure.
 In addition, ASAP defines each logical communication destination as a pool, providing full transparent support for server pooling and load sharing. It also allows dynamic system scalability -- members of a server pool can be added or removed at any time without interrupting the service.
 ASAP is designed to take full advantage of the network level redundancy provided by the Stream Transmission Control Protocol~(SCTP, RFC 4960). Each transport protocol, other than SCTP, MUST have an accompanying transport mapping document. It should be noted that ASAP messages passed between Pool Elements~(PEs) and ENRP servers MUST use the SCTP transport protocol.
 The high-availability server pooling is gained by combining two protocols, namely ASAP and ENRP, in which ASAP provides the user interface for Pool Handle to address translation, load sharing management, and fault management, while ENRP defines the high- availability Pool Handle translation service. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.}",

On decapsulation, it updates both RFC~3168 and RFC~4301 to add new behaviours for previously unused combinations of inner and outer headers. The new rules ensure the ECN field is correctly propagated across a tunnel whether it is used to signal one or two severity levels of congestion; whereas before, only one severity level was supported. Tunnel endpoints can be updated in any order without affecting pre-existing uses of the ECN field, thus ensuring backward compatibility. Nonetheless, operators wanting to support two severity levels~(e.g., for pre-congestion notification -- PCN) can require compliance with this new specification. A thorough analysis of the reasoning for these changes and the implications is included. In the unlikely event that the new rules do not meet a specific need, RFC~4774 gives guidance on designing alternate ECN semantics, and this document extends that to include tunnelling issues.}",

Thank- you! In summary, we have four independent implementations of all the MPTCP signalling messages, with the exception of address management, and some interoperabiity testing has been done by the other three implementations with the 'reference' Linux implementation. So it appears that the RFC is~(at least largely) clear and correct. On address management, we have only one implementation of ADD_ADDR with two teams choosing not to implement it. We have one implementation of the working group's coupled congestion control~(RFC6356) and none of the MPTCP-aware API~(RFC6897). The main suggested improvements are around o how MPTCP falls back~(if the signalling is interrupted by a middlebox):~(1) corner cases that are not handled properly,~(2) at the IETF, the MPTCP community should work with middlebox vendors, either to reduce or eliminate the need for fallback or to understand the middlebox interactions better. o security: both better MPTCP security~(perhaps building on SSL) and a lighter weight mechanism, preferably both in one mechanism. It is hoped that the next version can include information from any other implementations.

Resource usage within the network would be more efficient were it possible for these multiple paths to be used concurrently. Multipath TCP is a proposal to achieve multipath transport in TCP. New congestion control algorithms are needed for multipath transport protocols such as Multipath TCP, as single path algorithms have a series of issues in the multipath context. One of the prominent problems is that running existing algorithms such as TCP New Reno independently on each path would give the multipath flow more than its fair share at a bottleneck link traversed by more than one of its subflows. Further, it is desirable that a source with multiple paths available will transfer more traffic using the least congested of the paths, hence achieving resource pooling. This would increase the overall utilization of the network and also its robustness to failure. This document presents a congestion control algorithm which couples the congestion control algorithms running on different subflows by linking their increase functions, and dynamically controls the overall aggresiveness of the multipath flow. The result is a practical algorithm that is fair to TCP at bottlenecks while moving traffic away from congested links.}",

The data transport is augmented by a control protocol~(RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.

There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used.

This document proposes HighSpeed TCP, a modification to TCP's congestion control mechanism for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows. The congestion control mechanisms of the current Standard TCP constrains the congestion windows that can be achieved by TCP in realistic environments. For example, for a Standard TCP connection with 1500-byte packets and a 100 ms round-trip time, achieving a steady-state throughput of 10 Gbps would require an average congestion window of 83,333 segments, and a packet drop rate of at most one congestion event every 5,000,000,000 packets~(or equivalently, at most one congestion event every 1 2/3 hours). This is widely acknowledged as an unrealistic constraint.

LEDBAT is designed for use by background bulk-transfer applications to be no more aggressive than standard TCP congestion control~(as specified in RFC~5681) and to yield in the presence of competing flows, thus limiting interference with the network performance of competing flows.

Since delivery of a SACKed out-of-order DATA chunk is not guaranteed, a copy of this DATA chunk MUST be kept in the data sender's retransmission queue until this DATA chunk is cumulatively acked. By definition, data that has been delivered to the application is non-renegable by the SCTP data receiver. ~(Recall that, in SCTP, out- of-order data can sometimes be delivered.) Also, SCTP implementations can be configured such that the SCTP data receiver is not allowed to, and therefore, never reneges on out-of-order data. With SCTP's current SACK mechanism, non-renegable out-of-order data is selectively acked, and is~(wrongly) deemed renegable by the SCTP data sender. This document specifies an extension to SCTP's acknowledgment mechanism called Non-Renegable Selective Acknowledgements~(NR-SACKs.) NR-SACKs enable a data receiver to explicitly inform the data sender of non-renegable out-of-order data. As opposed to renegable data, a data sender can consider non-renegable data as never requiring retransmission, and therefore can remove non-renegable data from the retransmission queue.}",

In addition, ASAP defines each logical communication destination as a pool, providing full transparent support for server-pooling and load sharing. It also allows dynamic system scalability -- members of a server pool can be added or removed at any time without interrupting the service. ASAP is designed to take full advantage of the network level redundancy provided by the Stream Transmission Control Protocol~(SCTP) [RFC4960]. Each transport protocol, other than SCTP, MUST have an accompanying transport mapping document. It should be noted that ASAP messages passed between PE's and ENRP servers MUST use the SCTP transport protocol. The high availability server pooling is gained by combining two protocols, namely ASAP and ENRP, in which ASAP provides the user interface for pool handle to address translation, load sharing management, and fault management while ENRP defines the high availability pool handle translation service.}",

New congestion control algorithms are needed for multipath transport protocols such as Multipath TCP, as single path algorithms have a series of issues in the multipath context. One of the prominent problems is that running existing algorithms such as standard TCP independently on each path would give the multipath flow more than its fair share at a bottleneck link traversed by more than one of its subflows. Further, it is desirable that a source with multiple paths available will transfer more traffic using the least congested of the paths, achieving a property called resource pooling where a bundle of links effectively behaves like one shared link with bigger-capacity. This would increase the overall efficiency of the network and also its robustness to failure. This document presents a congestion control algorithm which couples the congestion control algorithms running on different subflows by linking their increase functions, and dynamically controls the overall aggressiveness of the multipath flow. The result is a practical algorithm that is fair to TCP at bottlenecks while moving traffic away from congested links.}",

This document outlines architectural guidelines for the development of a Multipath Transport Protocol, with references to how these architectural components come together in the development of a Multipath TCP protocol. This document lists certain high level design decisions that provide foundations for the design of the MPTCP protocol, based upon these architectural requirements.}",

	abstract = "{The Stream Control Transmission Protocol~(SCTP) as defined in RFC~4960 is an advanced Transport Layer protocol that provides support for multi-homing. That is, SCTP endpoints may simultaneously use multiple Network Layer addresses, which allows to connect the endpoints to multiple networks for redundancy purposes. However, for the transfer of user data, only one of the possible paths is currently used at a time. All other paths remain as backup and are only used for retransmissions.
Clearly, the existence of multiple paths has led to the idea of applying load sharing among the paths. An extension to SCTP -- denoted as Concurrent Multipath Transfer~(CMT) -- realises this load sharing functionality. While this approach works well for similar paths, i.e.\ paths having similar characteristics regarding bandwidths, bit error rates and delays, the use of dissimilar paths does not work that neatly.
In this thesis, the issues of dissimilar paths for CMT-based load sharing will be demonstrated first. The reasons for these issues will be identified and solutions proposed. These solutions will be evaluated in simulations, as well as partially also in a real-world Internet testbed setup, in order to show their effectiveness. In particular, it will be shown that a combination of multiple mechanisms is necessary to make CMT work as expected under a wide range of network and system parameters.
Furthermore, the fairness of CMT-based transport -- in concurrency to classic non-CMT flows -- will be analysed. The usage of plain CMT leads to an overly aggressive bandwidth occupation on so-called shared bottlenecks. As a countermeasure, the idea of Resource Pooling will be utilised. For this purpose, two new and one adapted congestion control approach -- all based on the Resource Pooling principle -- will be introduced and examined in similar as well as dissimilar path setups, in order to show how to fairly deploy CMT transport in the Internet.
The results of this work have also been contributed to the ongoing IETF~standardisation process of SCTP and its extensions.}",

Zudem ist eine große Flexibilität erforderlich, um auch weiteren – heute noch nicht absehbaren – Anforderungen gerecht zu werden.
Im Rahmen dieses Habilitationsvortrages wird zunächst kurz auf die Probleme des aktuellen Internets eingegangen sowie die Herausforderungen des Future Internets vorgestellt. Im Anschluss daran wird eine Auswahl der für den Übergang zum Future Internet möglichen evolutionären sowie revolutionären Ansätze vorgestellt. Der Schwerpunkt liegt hierbei auf den noch relativ neuen – und in der Forschung momentan sehr aktiv diskutierten – revolutionären Ansätzen, welche mit der Idee des sogenannten Clean Slate einen vollständigen Neuansatz anstreben. Hierbei werden die Ansätze der Funktionalen Komposition, des Content-Centric Networking sowie der Virtualisierung von Netzwerken vorgestellt.

Initial goal of this thesis is to gain insight into the complex RSerPool mechanisms by performing experimental and simulative proof-of-concept tests. The further goals are to systematically validate the RSerPool architecture and its protocols, provide improvements and optimizations where necessary and propose extensions if useful. Based on these evaluations, recommendations to implementers and users of RSerPool should be provided, giving guidelines for the tuning of system parameters and the appropriate configuration of application scenarios. In particular, it is also a goal to transfer insights, optimizations and extensions of the RSerPool protocols from simulation to reality and also to bring the achievements from research into application by supporting and contributing relevant results to the IETF's ongoing RSerPool standardization process.
To achieve the described goals, a prototype implementation as well as a simulation model are designed and realized at first. Using a generic application model and appropriate performance metrics, the performance of RSerPool systems in failure-free and server failure scenarios is systematically evaluated in order to identify critical parameter ranges and problematic protocol behaviour. Improvements developed as result of these performance analyses are evaluated and finally contributed into the standardization process of RSerPool.}",

	abstract = "{The Internet is developing with a very high speed. Just a few years ago, its main applications were file transfer and e-mail access, all based on the best effort TCP/IP service over quite slow links. With the quickly growing deployment of high-speed Internet accesses, there is a growing demand for also using the Internet in application scenarios like real-time multimedia streaming, particularly for audio and video on demand services. However, such multimedia applications do not only require sufficient bandwidth. They have stricter quality of service demands, like e.g.\ an upper bound on the transfer delay to ensure interactivity for their users.
In the context of this thesis, a system for the cost-efficient transfer of variable bitrate multimedia streams over Differentiated Services~(DiffServ) is presented and evaluated. This system supports layered transmission, i.e.\ streams may be partitioned into sub-streams denoted as layers (e.g.\ a video layer and an audio layer). Distinct layers may have different priorities as well as quality of service requirements and may therefore use different DiffServ classes for data transmission. Also, the streams may be scalable, i.e.\ the quality of the transferred media may be decreased in order to reduce the bandwidth requirements when bandwidth becomes scarce. Particularly, the system makes use of the fact that media files in e.g.\ a video on demand library can be analyzed a priorily. The information that is computed during the offline analysis is used to realize a dynamic and cost-efficient transport of layer data over different DiffServ classes. Furthermore, the system applies an adaptive buffering to smooth the flows -- in order to save bandwidth -- while also taking care of the delay constraints.}",

	abstract = "{Load sharing on the transport layer of the OSI reference model is an important topic in the IETF standardization. This approach is also supported by the industry to optimize the use of the resources in a network like the Internet. After many trials, two basic sets of mechanisms and functionalities on the transport layer have been proposed by the IETF to achieve load sharing. These basic sets extend the protocol mechanisms that were originally designed for the use in singlepath dominated networks and represent only a first step to introduce a real end-to-end multipath transfer on the Internet. These first basic sets must be investigated and improved for the next steps. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) provide the basis for the two IETF end-to-end multipath extensions. Both singlepath transport protocols have a different historical background but similar goals. These can be characterized by a reliable, connection-oriented and ordered data transport. However, initial experiments with the IETF multipath extensions in real networks show unexpected and in some cases clearly inadequate results. It is becoming rather apparent that the singlepath transport protocol specifications with their singlepath goals have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the load sharing mechanism and, furthermore, that the severity of the influence depends on the topology. The new mechanisms for multipath transfer include, in particular, an extended “path management” and “scheduling” task. The mechanisms addressing the path management organize the new, alternative paths and the scheduling mechanisms sup- port their effective use. For both protocol extensions of TCP and SCTP, an interaction can be identified between the new load sharing mechanisms and the existing specifications for singlepath transfer. This thesis systematically identifies the impact factors of the singlepath specifications on the new load sharing mechanisms and demonstrates their effects. In addition to the focus on the optimal use, the fair distribution of resources across all connections must be taken into account in the IETF standardization process. This so-called “fairness” discus- sion is mandatory for a transport protocol in the IETF context and has a direct impact on the overall system performance. Furthermore, this thesis discusses the currently implemented load sharing extensions and analyzes their weaknesses. Moreover, in this work new design approaches are developed to decrease the impact.}",

	abstract = "{Peer-to-peer networks (P2P) are distributed systems that consist of equal nodes (“peers”). In contrast to classic client/server systems, there is no hierarchy or central entity: All peers offer services and use them at the same time. In the past decade, a multitude of different P2P applications has been developed – filesharing applications such as BitTorrent and eMule and communication applications such as Skype are among the most popular of them. Research has shown that P2P networks are vulnerable to different kinds of attacks. Known attacks include, e.g., the Sybil attack and the Eclipse attack. Traditional countermeasures against the attacks are replication and the usage of disjoint routing paths to reduce the probability of interacting with malicious nodes during a routing or storage operation. More recently, trust mechanisms have been proposed and analyzed for applicability to P2P networks. The existing related work mostly targets unstructured P2P networks – however, in real-world environments, the structured networks prevail. Especially implementations of the Kademlia algorithm are widely spread, as it is used by BitTorrent and eMule. Nevertheless, none of the trust-based approaches that aim at structured networks specifically attempts to enhance Kademlia’s security. Due to Kademlia’s prevalence, TrustedKad is particularly designed by the author to improve the security of the Kademlia algorithm. In this thesis, TrustedKad is introduced and its functioning is explained. TrustedKad rates the behavior of nodes after routing and storage operations as either positive or negative. To do so, it defines the rules by which inoffensive and malicious behavior is identified in dependence of the functioning of the Kademlia algorithm. Based on the ratings, routing and storage trust values are calculated to identify inoffensive and malicious nodes. Every node uses thresholds for these trust values to decide which nodes it regards as trustworthy. Non-trustworthy nodes are avoided during a node’s own operations. Furthermore, TrustedKad uses additional security features to further increase the security of the system. They are introduced in this thesis. In order to evaluate TrustedKad, it is implemented and analyzed in a simulation environment. The results presented in this thesis show that TrustedKad is able to distinguish inoffensive and malicious nodes. It counters miscellaneous variations of known attacks and improves the security of Kademlia-based networks considerably.}",

The expansion of MBB traffic necessitates the detail study of the characteristics of MBB networks with regards to network performance and reliability. It is observed that the literature towards the study of MBB performance mostly concern static scenarios. Therefore, in this thesis, effects of mobility on MBB performance are studied, and the QoS performance of Norwegian MBB networks under mobility are compared to provide a realistic view of the QoS characteristics experienced by the end-users. For this, performance metrics such as delay, packet loss, connectivity are measured for four operational MBB networks under mobility simultaneously using NorNet Edge (NNE), the dedicated testbed for experimentation and measurements in MBB networks. Measurements in different speed are examined to see how speed affects MBB performance. Radio conditions such as Local Area Code (LAC), Cell Identification (CellID) are also investigated to establish relation between the measured performance and physical locations as well as cell attachment and handover behaviors. Mode and Submode are also observed to see 2G/3G networks coverage and packet distribution in HSPA+, HSDPA, HSUPA, WCDMA and EDGE networks. The results of this thesis show that MBB performance is affected (degraded) by mobility, but degree varies with respect to performance metrics. It was found that MBB operators under mobility perform differently even though the underlying technology is same.}",

We used NorNet Edge node which is connected to 3 different 3G ISP{'}s (UMTS and CDMA2000). We also use three different TCP congestion control algorithms: TCP NewReno, TCP CUBIC as loss-based algorithms and TCP Vegas as delay based algorithms and try to see the impact of each TCP congestion control algorithm on the QoS characteristics. In the other word, we want to see how each MBB provider could affect the same TCP connection with same characteristics. We present QoS characteristics (e.g. Goodput, delay) and discuss our observations. Our results could be used later for improvements in multi-path congestion controls.}",

Several studies are going on in order to getting the information about IPv6 which makes a contribution with improvement and deployment of IPv6 and accelerates this transitioning which one of the aspects is the Internet path stability. With this aid this thesis proposed a comparative study of Internet path stability over IPv4 and IPv6. First a measurement of Internet paths over both IP versions has been performed, then the Internet path changes have been extracted in each single set of source-destination pairs. Finally some analysis on the data has been performed in order to observe the stability of Internet paths and provided a comparative study in the set of IPv4 and IPv6.}",

The NorNet Core multi-homed network testbed aims to facilitate this research by offering programmable virtual machines located at multiple different sites across the world, accessible for researchers. The aim of this project is the design and implementation of a demonstration platform for NorNet Core that enables the testbed to be illustratively demonstrated to potential new users. This is done by offering users interactive experiments, and geographical visualization of various communication scenarios between nodes in the NorNet Core network in real time. The demonstration platform puts emphasis on demonstrating the unique aspects of NorNet Core compared to other networking testbeds, namely the multi-homed nature and IPv6 support for all of the nodes. This thesis discusses the technical aspects of designing and implementing the platform, as well as demonstrating the finished result with various demonstration scenarios. The Qt programming framework was chosen as the primary development framework for this application.}",

The project focuses on prevention, detection and mitigation of denial of service attacks in a vehicle platoon. To achieve this, a simulator was created using MATLAB and Simulink that can reproduce the physical workings of a vehicle platoon as well as the wireless communication between the vehicles and the possibility of malicious interference. Defence methods are implemented and tested against jamming attacks. These include methods of interference reduction, data redundancy and warning systems based on on-board vehicle sensors. The results presented are positive and successful in increasing a vehicle platoon s resiliency to attacks. It is the hope of the author that this work along with the simulating environment created, will provide an incentive for further development and examination.}",

	abstract = "{The explosive deployment of wired and wireless communication infrastructure has recently enabled many novel applications and sparked new research problems. One of the unsolved issues in today’s Internet – the main topic of this thesis – is the goal of increasing data transfer speeds of end hosts by aggregating and simultaneously using multiple network interfaces. This objective is most interesting when the Internet is accessible through several, relatively slow and variable (typically wireless) networks, which are unable to single-handedly provide the required data rate for resource-intensive applications, such as bulk file transfers and high-definition multimedia streaming. Communication devices equipped with multiple network interfaces are now commonplace. Smartphones and laptops are often shipped with built-in network adapters of different wireless technologies, typically enabling them to connect to wireless local area networks and cellular data networks (such as WLAN and HSPA). At the same time, wireless network coverage has become so widespread that mobile devices are often located in overlapping coverage areas of independent access networks. However, even if multiple interfaces are successfully connected to the Internet, operating systems typically use only a single default interface for data transmission, leaving secondary interfaces idle. This technical restriction is based on the fact that the majority of current Internet traffic is conveyed by transport protocols (TCP and UDP) that do not support multiple IP addresses per endpoint. Another crucial factor is that path heterogeneity introduces packet reordering, which can negatively affect the performance of transport protocols and strain the buffer requirements of applications. This thesis explores the problem of multipath aggregation with the attempt to find solutions that achieve increased data throughput by concurrently utilizing heterogeneous and dynamic access networks. We strive for approaches that support existing applications without requiring significant modifications to the current infrastructure. The exploration starts at the IP layer with a study of the IP packet reordering that is caused by the use of heterogeneous paths. Our practical experiments confirm that multipath reordering exceeds the typical packet reordering in the Internet by an extent that renders the usual reordering metric useless. The outcome of our network-layer study is a proxy-based, adaptive multipath scheduler that is able to mitigate packet reordering while transparently forwarding a single transport connection over multiple paths. After introducing a novel metric for quantifying the benefit of path aggregation, our analysis continues on the transport layer, where we investigate TCP’s resilience to multipath-inflicted packet reordering. While IP packet reordering is known for its destructive effect on TCP’s performance, our practical experiments indicate that a modern implementation is significantly more robust to packet reordering than standard TCP and achieves a substantial aggregation benefit even in certain cases of extreme multipath heterogeneity. In addition, we run a large set of emulation-based multipath experiments and identify several TCP parameters that lead to improved multipath performance when correctly tuned. Finally, we present an application-layer solution that builds upon the idea of logical file segmentation for streaming a single video to multihomed clients. The novelity of this approach lies in diverting standard protocol features (i.e., HTTP pipelining and range retrieval requests) from their intended purpose and using them for scheduling video segments over different paths. Interoperable with existing server infrastructure, our proposed solution can be deployed in a lightweight and purely client-based manner. We validate the proposed algorithms by implementing them into an existing video streaming platform.}",

The protocol is applicable to systems communicating via packet networks. Heterogeneous systems are enabled that include clocks of various inherent precision, resolution, and stability to synchronize. System-wide synchronization accuracy and precision in the sub-microsecond range are supported with minimal network and local clock computing resources. Simple systems are installed and operated without requiring the management attention of users because the default behavior of the protocol allows for it.}"

	abstract = "{Despite the extraordinary success of the cellular mobile telecommunications industry, many of the underlying design strategies and service assumptions that have served us arguably well over the past four decades may benefit from a fresh new look. Even today’s LTE (Long–Term Evolution), which is designed to meet the demands of modern broadband Internet packet connectivity, nonetheless draws heavily on the legacy of cellular’s circuit–oriented origins. Its heavy reliance on fine–grained tunnels and hard–state signaling protocols, for example, imposes performance penalties and cost burdens that may not be inevitable if hard–earned lessons are incorporated in the coming years. In this paper we describe a fresh approach to cellular network architecture. Inspired by past and present ideas and experiences by others and ours, we propose fundamental principles to guide the development of efficient and flexible network architecture, able to serve the still unknown needs and preferences of future users. We offer an example of a network built on those principles and suggest how we can manage the evolution from today’s networks to an architecture better suited to the decades ahead.}",
