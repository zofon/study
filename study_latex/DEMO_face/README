    titlepages.pdf displays some 40 different designs of title pages
taken from a selection of books and theses. The code for the examples 
is included. A variety of colors and fonts are used in the examples. 

    If you wish to process the source file titlepages.tex, by either 
pdflatex or xelatex, consider saving titlepages.pdf under another name 
before doing so in case not all the fonts are available on your system. 
In any case, read the advice at the beginning of the file titlepages.tex.

    The work is distributed under the LaTeX Project Public Licence.
